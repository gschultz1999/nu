      <h1>So many resources spread out in too many areas</h1>
      <p>School is time consuming enough with all the projects and homework, top it off with piles of content to study, anyone would get overwhelmed, in fact most people do.</p>
      <h3>What do you use to study, textbook, lectures, quizlet?</h3>
      <p>When I was in school I used everything around me, ATI, quizlet, textbooks, etc. I would take practice tests on ATI, spend hours making so many flashcards by the time I was done I could barely use them. I would highlight through what felt like endless amounts of pages, or take 100's of practice questions just for none of them to be on the test.</p>
      <h4>Why not just use one?</h4>
      <p>This website tackles this problem, there is just not enough time in school to do everything. You want to learn and succeed, same as I did. I made this website to solve the issues above, a website with all of the tools above, condensed into one website with easy access.</p>

      <p>This site isn't just to retain mountains of information, my goal is to get you to understand, so even if a question you haven't seen before appears on the test, you can make an educated guess for the correct answer.</p>

<div id="About-us">
  <h1 class="about">Who am I?</h1>
  <h2 class="title">Founded in 2024 by a Registered Nurse.</h2>
  <article class="article">
    I am simply someone who does not like structured classrooms, but loves knowledge. Being able to learn new information to better yourself about something you are passionate about is a beautiful thing. I want to help those of you who struggle in a lecture, who need help after lectures, those of you in a time crunch (Hello fellow procrastinators), the visual learners who read the textbook and realize way too late that there is a suffocating amount of information and just need to have one place where they can get all the reading they need without spending hours and hours usually highlighting material that you probably won't read back on but once (Hello also to my fellow visual learners). I simply want to help.
